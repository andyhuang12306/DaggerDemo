for Dagger Provide, the only thing you need to know is when we need to provide.

Firstly, i will give some explaintation for how Dagger gets the Objects injected.
Let me give an example:
Boss for ProvideTestActivity in our example
Meal for App
Assistant for ProvideTestComponent
Cook hired by Boss to make meal for him here for ProvideTestModule
TakeOut for Inject Constructor as InjectBean's constructor

now boss wants some meal for launch. Assistant contact Cook if Cook is available then Cook will
make the meal and provide it to Assistant and Assistant will provide for boss. while if Cook is
not available then Assistant will contact TakeOut to delivery the meal.

that how Dagger provide the objects needs to be injected.

so the key points is as following:
1. two way to get injectable objects: Module's Provide and Inject Constructor
2. the Priority of Module's provide is higher than Inject Constructor's
